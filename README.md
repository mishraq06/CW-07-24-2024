Hi there! I am a motivated graduate at the Bronx High School of Science and a rising freshman at CCNY with a keen interest in exploring the intersection of technology and finance and excited about the opportunities they present in today's interconnected world. My long-term goal is to become a pioneer in the world of artificial intelligence and computer science, particularly in the realm of developing innovative algorithms and software programs that can transform the way we interact with and leverage technology to reshape the world. Please feel free to reach out at ishraqm@bxscience.edu if you'd like to chat!
